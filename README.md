# Python
As a PhD student on offshore winds, I analyse large datasets from weather models and observations, and also play around with code to conceptualize some thoughts.
For atmospheric modelling, I mostly use WRF. Traditionally, WRF is often analysed with NCL, but I don't like its syntax. Therefore, I created a lot of own scripts for WRF analysis.
